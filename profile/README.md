### Purpose

Each repository generates dynamic browser sources that can be used in OBS (Open Broadcaster Software). These sources allow for the modification of their values directly from the browser or by sending events using applications like StreamDeck or similar tools.

### Inspiraci√≥n Behind this Project

My insatiable curiosity for continuous learning in programming, particularly NodeJS, my enthusiasm for Twitch streaming, and the quest for OBS resources that proved elusive have all culminated in the genesis of this project. In my pursuit, I scoured for functions and utilities, not only for my own use but also for my fellow streamers. When I couldn't find them, I embarked on the journey of developing them myself.
